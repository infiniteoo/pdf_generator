# PDF Generator 
Utilzing React and a plugin called HTML-PDF, we can generate a PDF file after receiving input from the user.  Whatever the user inputs will be reflected in the final PDF file along with a graphic, and other bits of information to become a valid receipt for any transaction.

This fundamental ability is essential to the success of any would-be full-stack web developer wanting to work in the e-commerce industry.
